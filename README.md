# Paper Title Generation from Abstracts

## Overview
This project aims to automatically generate **research paper titles** from given **abstracts** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques.  
A fine-tuned **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** model is used to understand abstract text and generate a concise, contextually appropriate title.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate the process of research paper title generation.  
- Explore the use of transformer-based models for sequence-to-sequence tasks.  
- Demonstrate fine-tuning of a pre-trained model (T5-small) using a small custom dataset.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Takes a **research abstract** as input and produces a **probable title** as output.  
- Built and trained entirely using **Hugging Face Transformers** and **PyTorch**.  
- Interactive mode to test custom abstracts.  
- Works locally or in **Google Colab** without any external API keys.
